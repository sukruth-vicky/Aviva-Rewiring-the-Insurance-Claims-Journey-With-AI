Insurance claims are one of the most critical moments in the customer journey. Speed, accuracy, and empathy directly influence trust. 
In this case, Aviva partnered with McKinsey & Company to rewire its end-to-end insurance claims journey using artificial intelligence, with the goal of improving customer experience while reducing operational friction.

Aviva faced challenges common to large insurers. Claims handling involved multiple handoffs, manual reviews, and fragmented data across systems. 
Customers experienced delays, adjusters spent time on low-value tasks, and complex claims required deeper insight that was not always readily available.

McKinsey supported Aviva in redesigning the claims journey from intake to settlement. The transformation focused on embedding AI across key decision points rather than treating it as a standalone tool. 
Advanced machine-learning models were used to triage claims, detect complexity early, automate routine decisions, and assist handlers with real-time insights.

AI models analyzed historical claims data, images, documents, and customer inputs to predict claim severity, likelihood of fraud, and optimal routing. 
Straightforward claims were processed automatically, while complex cases were routed to experienced handlers with AI-generated recommendations.

The new operating model reduced manual effort and improved decision quality. Claims handlers were supported by AI copilots that surfaced relevant information, suggested next actions, and reduced rework. 
Customers benefited from faster responses, clearer communication, and quicker settlements.

Pilot results showed measurable impact. Claims processing times reduced by approximately 30 to 40 percent, straight-through processing rates increased significantly, and handler productivity improved by nearly 25 percent. 
Customer satisfaction scores rose as resolution times shortened and transparency improved.

This case demonstrates how AI can transform insurance operations when combined with process redesign, strong data foundations, and frontline adoption. 
Aviva’s journey shows that rewiring workflows around AI creates sustainable gains in both efficiency and customer experience.
